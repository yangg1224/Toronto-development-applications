#Introduction 



# Setup workspace and gather data
In this paper, all the analysis are conducted by R statistical programming language.[@citeR] Through the **opendatatoronto** package, I download the data set for toronto development applications. This package allows users to download the data set in a reproducible way.[@citeO] The data are also availavle at this link:https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/development-applications/. In terms of data cleaning, I will use **tidyverse** package.[@tidy] Another two data Visualization packages used in the Exploratory Data Analysis are **ggploat2** [@ggplot] and **kableExtra**[@kable]
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(opendatatoronto)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(kableExtra)
```
